It’s supposed to snow again today but that will not dissuade me from getting my bike all fixed up for the summer season.\nIn honour of tune up day, why not explore some City of Calgary bicycle data. The City has a plethora of public data available for perusal and bicycle data is no different.

That would help confirm that theory, but I think that’s it for me today.\nPS - tune up day was NOT a success. Tune up guy was no longer accepting bikes by the time I got there. He basically laughed in my face! Apparently tune up day is popular."

In addition to struggling to figure out what to plot with this data, I spent probably an hour trying to figure out how to include a hyperlink in a ggplot2 image. A lot more difficult than I expected! I never did find a simple enough solution for my liking so I have now moved on. This stack overflow post appeared to have the most promise but the juice just wasn’t worth the squeeze for my use case. I feel like coming back to this issue but perhaps at a later date. And perhaps next Sunday I’ll get around to cleaning this blog.\nLooking back at the 2023-03-28 Tidy Tuesday README, there is a link to Twitter’s guidelines for how to add alt text to your images. To my surprise, the link isn’t broken! Looks like the folks who maintain the Tidy Tuesday repository gave up on mentioning Twitter on 2023-07-25 though.\n2023-03-28 is all about timezones. The plot ideas aren’t coming to me quickly here but I did manage to uncover some interesting tidbits about my timezone (Canada/Mountain).\n\nThe official record of the Canada/Mountain timezone began in 1906-09-01\nInitially, the timezone did not include daylight savings time until 1918\nDST was then abandoned between 1923 and 1942 before changing to permanent DST between 1942 and 1945\nAfter some brief back and forth between DST and standard time, permanent standard time lasted from 1947 to 1972. The glory years.\nFrom 1972 on, the twice a year switch between DST to ST persists. Boo!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduciton\nI started getting into TidyTuesday again recently. This, timed with Nicola Rennie’s post about her webR powered Shiny App, inspired me to try and build a Shiny App to display my TidyTuesday plots! And by build, I mean re-create (rip-off?) her Shiny App, but with my plots.\n\n\nTidy directory\nRight off the hop, she talks about a pretty consistent structure to her TidyTuesday repository. Looking at mine, it’s not completely disorganized but could use some tidying. I guess a TidyTuesday repository should be tidy so let’s go ahead and do that.\nFirst, a separate directory to organize each week’s TidyTuesday plots and code: /yyyy/yyyy-mm-dd/. My code files and plot image files were already named fairly well. yyyy-mm-dd.R was the format for the code files, and yyyy-mm-dd_plot_title.png was the format for the plot image files. This seems to line up well enough with Nicola’s standard, so I’ll leave them as is.\nShe also leverages the READMEs she has for each Tidy Tuesday to extract information about the plot title for that specific week. There are occasions where I save multiple plots for a single Tidy Tuesday so I might have to approach this a bit differently. For now, I’ll copy this approach as my initial idea to extract the plot titles from file names seemed messy. Maybe I can just reference my favourite plot from the week. Or perhaps the READMEs can have both plots. Regardless, I’m going to add some READMEs!\n\n\nExtract directory info\nNext up - create a tibble with information on all the Tidy Tuesday files in my Tidy Tuesday repository. Feel free to check out the post that outlines the code in more detail but a couple of neat lessons that I took away from this part:\n\nlist.dirs(): a fun little function to produce a character vector with file names and directory names in a specified directory! Kind of surprised I haven’t needed anything like this in the past\ntidyr::separate_wider_delim(): a handy tool to split up a string column into multiple string columns based on a delimeter. This function is handy because it handles when there are too few or too many splits. In this case, if there are too many cases, we just drop the remainder.\ntidyr::separate_longer_delim():\nmutate(new_col = NA_character_): instead of blindly assigning NA values to a new column, this ensures it is a character column! Looks like you can do this with integers and real numbers as well. I’m sure there are others but a quick google search didn’t bring up a full list.\nstop(): this wasn’t referenced in the blog post but I wasn’t sure how to handle errors in R. I think this seems to be a suitable replacement for the try/except statements that I’m used to in python\nattachment: this library was leveraged to find the packages used for each Tidy Tuesday script. Had not seen this before. Pretty cool.\ntidyr::complete():\n\nI assume this little tibble is going to be the key source data for this app.\n\n\nGithub actions\nNicola updates this tibble after every Tidy Tuesday contribution via a GitHub action. I’m a little hesitant to take this approach because this requires me to be a little more thoughtful about what I push to my main branch. Perhaps I should get in the habit of making feature branches for each Tidy Tuesday week and only pushing to main once a final product is ready. Regardless, I might as well set this up as a learning exercise.\nThe action itself is pretty straightforward but one thing I hadn’t seen was the “Commit files” step at the end. This allows the action to commit all of the created files from the action script. Since we’re updating the app data with this action, we’ll want that file committed during this action run. Pretty handy!\nAnother thing I haven’t leveraged in the past is GitHub Secrets. I’ll need to set-up a token to run the action and then save that token to this repository’s Secrets. For now, I’ll save the example .yml from Nicola’s post, with a few minor changes, and move on.\n\n\nShiny\nIt’s been a hot minute since I’ve played around with Shiny so this step was pretty foreign to me. I recall all the basic elements of setting up an app (the ui and the server), but it took some time to get used to the different layouts, panels, outputs and the reactive elements.\nI decided to differ slightly from Nicola’s app by ignoring the radio buttons and just sticking to a drop down list of all the plot titles. This makes the app code more simple and the actual interface a bit cleaner in my opinion. I like the idea of filtering plots based on packages used but I think it’s more of a nice to have at this point.\nOther than this one difference, the app code is basically the same and I was up and running with a local version pretty quickly."

I have my full 4 year historical tracklist saved in a Google Sheet so why not see if I can read that into Quarto and play around with the data.\ngooglesheets4 appears to be the Posit built R interface to Google Sheets so I’m going to give that a try. Fun fact - the 4 in googlesheets4 references the version of the Sheets API. It’s not because Jennifer Bryan (the developer of googlesheets4) liked the number 4. In my opinion, that would have been a good enough reason :)\nSince my radio tracklist is saved in a private Google Sheet, authentication will be required.

Running ?chattr_use in the R Console pulls up some details to resolve this error. Looks like the easiest way to setup a model is to grab an OpenAI Personal Access Token (PAT). My preference would be to run a local LLM but maybe I can look into setting that up later.\nAfter creating a PAT on the OpenAI website, I created an .Renviron file in my project directory and saved the token there under OPENAI_API_KEY. It looks like that’s all it took to set-up the model. I can now run chattr_app().\n\nlibrary(chattr)\nchattr::chattr_app()\n\n• Provider:\n\n\n• Path/URL:\n\n\n• Model:\n\n\n• Label:\n\n\nShiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents\n\n\nThis seems to open the Shiny App but sending a prompt to OpenAI doesn’t return any response. After an unfortunate amount of time looking through Google, running chattr::chattr(\"hello\") gives me an error message that might be a clue to resolving my problem:\n{error}Type:insufficient_quota\nMessage: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.\nBased on my usage details on the OpenAI website, I should have plenty of quota to work with. Other folks online have reported a similar issue and have noted that it goes away after a few days. Perhaps I’ll check back on this later.\nThis unsuccessful AI exercise reminds me that I need to read Molly White’s article AI isn’t useless. But is it worth it?. Unfortunately, I’m not sure this foray into chattr was worth much today!"

    "text": "Albert Rapp publishes a weekly post called 3 Minute Wednesdays (3MW) that I’ve been following for quite some time but haven’t really dived into the material in too much detail. The posts are quick learning opportunities that I think I should take more advantage of so today, I’ll be walking through the example from his post on event listeners for Shiny.\nFor this exercise, I’ll use the Shiny app I developed to visualize daily bike counts in Calgary. At the moment, the application renders a new plot every time a new location is selected from a dropdown menu. The lesson from this post is that we can control when the plot renders or in other words, we can control “reactivity”.\nThe post presents a number of ways to control reactivity but what I landed on was using bindEvent() in the server along with an actionButton() in the UI.\nThe gist of the original app looked like this:\nui &lt;- bslib::page_sidebar(\n  sidebar = sidebar(\n    # Dropdown menu\n    selectInput(\n      'location_dropdown',\n      'Select location',\n      choices = locations\n    )\n  ),\n  card(\n    plotOutput('bike_count_plot')\n  )\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  output$bike_count_plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n    df %&gt;%\n      filter(monitoring_location == input$location_dropdown) %&gt;%\n      ggplot(aes(x = date, y = daily_total)) +\n      geom_point()\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui, server)\nIn order to control reactivity with an actionButton() and bindEvent(), I added what boils down to three lines of code:\n\nAdd actionButton() in the sidebar in the ui object\n\nactionButton('button', 'Reload Plot')  # New action button\n\nAdd req() in renderPlot() to require a click on the button to initiate reactivity\n\nreq(input$button &gt;= 1)\n\nPass renderPlot() into bindEvent() with input$button\n\nrenderPlot({}) |&gt; bindEvent(input$button)\nHere’s what the app looks like now:\nui &lt;- bslib::page_sidebar(\n  sidebar = sidebar(\n    # Dropdown menu\n    selectInput(\n      'location_dropdown',\n      'Select location',\n      choices = locations\n    ),\n    actionButton('button', 'Reload Plot')  # New action button\n  ),\n  card(\n    plotOutput('bike_count_plot')\n  )\n)\n\nserver &lt;- function(input, output, session) {\n  output$bike_count_plot &lt;- renderPlot({\n  req(input$button &gt;= 1)  # New function to specify reactivity conditions\n    df %&gt;%\n      filter(monitoring_location == input$location_dropdown) %&gt;%\n      ggplot(aes(x = date, y = daily_total)) +\n      geom_point()\n  }) |&gt; bindEvent(input$button)  # Isolate inputs with bindEvent()\n}\nshinyApp(ui, server)"

My first crack at the demo in the following blog post was futile due to the inherent limitations in the default graphics device in Windows (explained in the post under the limitations section), so I turned to my MacBook to run through a few of the examples provided.\n\nlibrary(marquee)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmd_text &lt;- \"\n# Heading 1\n## Heading 2\n### Heading 3\n\"\n\nggplot(mtcars) + \n  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + \n  ggtitle(md_text) + \n  theme(plot.title = element_marquee(size = 8, width = unit(16, \"cm\")))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing I notice on my mac is that the rendered markdown text is super grainy compared with the plot text. Likely a result of the limitations explained in the blog post. Looks like a lot of potential here but perhaps best suited for folks with a better understanding of computer graphics than me."

I don’t currently have a place to share my work. I guess I’ll go with a blog.\nI also became familiar with Quarto and Quarto blogs after virtually attending rstudio::conf(2022). Quarto seemed like an interesting tool to present personal data work and Quarto blogs seemed like a dead simple way to compile that work. Why not start a blog to get the hang of this tool?\n\n\nPlans\nFor the most part, this blog will consist of things for my own personal consumption and reference. I’m not keen to share my work or my thoughts broadly but I’d like to have a place where I can direct people if I need to ~ show off ~ for any reason. This will be that place.\nI plan to share details on personal projects, some random data viz, and/or perhaps some thoughts from something I’m reading. A blog seems like a good place to compile these things, kind of like a journal, especially if I’ll be the primary consumer. I’d like to have this as a place where I can log things that I’m excited about.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis is my first attempt at a blog and it wasn’t overly complicated to set-up thanks to a couple of really helpful references.\nAlbert Rapp created The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog which has been a phenomenal resource for me.\nIsabella Velásquez also walked through building a blog with Quarto in this Youtube video. Really good stuff."

So that’s what today’s portfolio contribution will focus on.\nThis Shiny urge was partially prompted by Albert Rapp’s recent 3 Minute Wednesday (3MW) post and Garrick Aden-Buie’s talk on bslib. Both release really good resources on Shiny and make it inviting to give things a try. Using a few code snippets from each post, I was able to spin up a basic Shiny app in a few minutes using the bike from yesterday. I added a simple reactive element to display daily bike counts based on a user defined monitoring location. Pretty simple but a fun little intro to Shiny."

This is the serverless version of Shiny that I’ve seen used a couple of times but I’m going to follow Rami Krispin’s tutorial for this exercise.\nGoing into this exercise, I thought there would be much more to it. Turns out, all I had to do was rename my Shiny app file to app.R and run shinylive::export(appdir = \"shiny\", destdir = \"docs\"). Once the app finished rendering, I ran httpuv::runStaticServer(\"docs/\", port=8008) to get the app running on my browser.\nInclude some details on putting this on GitHub pages."
