    "text": "A blog?\nI’ve decided to start a blog. I’m not particularly great at writing nor am I keen on making my writing public for the World to see. So what am I doing here?\nWell, a blog seems like a great way for Data People to gather and share their work in a centralized place. I’m a Data Person. I don’t currently have a place to share my work but I’ve been meaning to create one for a long time. I guess I’ll go with a blog.\nI also became familiar with Quarto and Quarto blogs after virtually attending rstudio::conf(2022). Quarto seemed like an interesting tool to present personal data work and Quarto blogs seemed like a dead simple way to compile that work. Why not start a blog to get the hang of this tool?\n\n\nPlans\nFor the most part, this blog will consist of things for my own personal consumption and reference. Like I said, I’m not eager to share my work or my thoughts broadly but I’d still like to have a place where I can direct people if I need to ~ show off ~ for any reason. This will be that place.\nI plan to write about personal projects I’m working on, an analysis that I completed, maybe some thoughts and learnings from a book or a blog I’m reading, or perhaps just write for the sake of writing. A blog seems like a good place to compile these things, kind of like a journal, especially if I’ll be the primary consumer. I’d like to have this as a place where I can log things that I’m excited about.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis is my first attempt at a blog and it wasn’t overly complicated to set-up thanks to a couple of really helpful references.\nAlbert Rapp created The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog which has been a phenomenal resource for me. Perhaps the best advice in this behemoth of a blog plost is to write regularly. I’ll give it a try, Albert!\nIsabella Velásquez also walked through building a blog with Quarto in this Youtube video. Thanks for this!"

    "text": "Introduciton\nI started getting into TidyTuesday again recently. This, timed with Nicola Rennie’s post about her webR powered Shiny App, inspired me to try and build a Shiny App to display my TidyTuesday plots! And by build, I mean re-create (rip-off?) her Shiny App, but with my plots.\n\n\nTidy directory\nRight off the hop, she talks about a pretty consistent structure to her TidyTuesday repository. Looking at mine, it’s not completely disorganized but could use some tidying. I guess a TidyTuesday repository should be tidy so let’s go ahead and do that.\nFirst, a separate directory to organize each week’s TidyTuesday plots and code: /yyyy/yyyy-mm-dd/. My code files and plot image files were already named fairly well. yyyy-mm-dd.R was the format for the code files, and yyyy-mm-dd_plot_title.png was the format for the plot image files. This seems to line up well enough with Nicola’s standard, so I’ll leave them as is.\nShe also leverages the READMEs she has for each Tidy Tuesday to extract information about the plot title for that specific week. There are occasions where I save multiple plots for a single Tidy Tuesday so I might have to approach this a bit differently. For now, I’ll copy this approach as my initial idea to extract the plot titles from file names seemed messy. Maybe I can just reference my favourite plot from the week. Time to make some READMEs!\n\n\nExtract directory info\nNext up - create a tibble with information on all the Tidy Tuesday files. Feel free to check out the post that outlines the code in more detail but a couple of neat lessons that I took away from this part:\n\nlist.dirs(): a fun little function to produce a character vector with file names and directory names in a specified directory! Kind of surprised I haven’t needed anything like this in the past\ntidyr::separate_wider_delim(): a handy tool to split up a string column into multiple string columns based on a delimeter. This function is handy because it handles when there are too few or too many splits. In this case, if there are too many cases, we just drop the remainder.\nmutate(new_col = NA_character_): instead of blindly assigning NA values to a new column, this ensures it is a character column! Looks like you can do this with integers and real numbers as well. I’m sure there are others but a quick google search didn’t bring up a full list."

    "text": "To be honest, I didn’t think I’d get to day 2. This is a pretty big accomplishment. I can now draw a trend line. Two days in a row, baby!\nToday I completed the tedious task of creating READMEs for each of my contributions to Tidy Tuesday. This was a good exercise in making my weekly submissions more visible, as well as setting my repository up for extracting plot titles for the webR app I’m working on. It also helped me realize that I have quite a few unfinished Tidy Tuesday plots.\nThis reminds me that I should probably brainstorm some things I may want to accomplish over these 5 weeks. Considering I made it to day 2 (hell yeah!), there is a much more likely chance that I may actually accomplish a few things here. Here’s what I have so far:\n\nClean up and finish half baked Tidy Tuesday submissions\n\nSome you’ve barely started to code, some you’ve got a pretty garbage looking plot. Clean these bad boys up, Mike!\nWhile I’m here, might as well keep up the weekly habit of contributing to Tidy Tuesday! Flex those ggplot muscles, brother!\n\nCreate a shareable webR app to display Tidy Tuesday submissions\n\nI’m hoping this webR app doesn’t dominate this “blog” over the next 5 weeks but it’s been a slow go so far. But for a good reason. It’s been a great learning exercise. Why rush through it?\n\nDevelop a Shiny application for viewing basic Ultimate statistics\n\nThis will be a relatively easy exercise (famous last words you doof!) but it’s been a while since I’ve created anything in Shiny. Time to get on this band wagon again.\n\nFigure out how I can intersect my interest in data and my interest in radio/music\n\nI host a weekly radio program where I select records for 90 minutes. I have over 4,000 songs that I’ve played over the last 4 years. Why not tell some sort of data story here?\n\nExplore Survival Analysis in Tidy Models\n\nI’ve been thinking about a lot of different work related use cases for Survival Analysis recently. Why not check out how it’s done in Tidy Models? I’m sure they make it fairly straight forward to do!\n\n\nPerhaps I can do some more brainstorming later but I think that’s a good start. Lots to think about over the next 5 weeks!"

Based on how much I’m learning from this exercise, this whole 5 week challenge could potentially be about only this."
