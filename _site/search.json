    "text": "A blog?\nI’ve decided to start a blog. I’m not particularly great at writing nor am I keen on making my writing public for the World to see. So what am I doing here?\nWell, a blog seems like a great way for Data People to gather and share their work in a centralized place. I’m a Data Person. I don’t currently have a place to share my work but I’ve been meaning to create one for a long time. I guess I’ll go with a blog.\nI also became familiar with Quarto and Quarto blogs after virtually attending rstudio::conf(2022). Quarto seemed like an interesting tool to present personal data work and Quarto blogs seemed like a dead simple way to compile that work. Why not start a blog to get the hang of this tool?\n\n\nPlans\nFor the most part, this blog will consist of things for my own personal consumption and reference. Like I said, I’m not eager to share my work or my thoughts broadly but I’d still like to have a place where I can direct people if I need to ~ show off ~ for any reason. This will be that place.\nI plan to write about personal projects I’m working on, an analysis that I completed, maybe some thoughts and learnings from a book or a blog I’m reading, or perhaps just write for the sake of writing. A blog seems like a good place to compile these things, kind of like a journal, especially if I’ll be the primary consumer. I’d like to have this as a place where I can log things that I’m excited about.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis is my first attempt at a blog and it wasn’t overly complicated to set-up thanks to a couple of really helpful references.\nAlbert Rapp created The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog which has been a phenomenal resource for me. Perhaps the best advice in this behemoth of a blog plost is to write regularly. I’ll give it a try, Albert!\nIsabella Velásquez also walked through building a blog with Quarto in this Youtube video. Thanks for this!"

    "text": "I started getting into TidyTuesday again recently. This, timed with Nicola Rennie’s post about her webR powered Shiny App, inspired me to try and build a Shiny App to display my TidyTuesday plots! And by build, I mean re-create (rip-off?) her Shiny App, but with my plots.\nRight off the hop, she talks about a pretty consistent structure to her TidyTuesday repository. Looking at mine, it’s not completely disorganized but could use some tidying. I guess a TidyTuesday repository should be tidy so let’s go ahead and do that.\nFirst, a separate directory to organize each week’s TidyTuesday plots and code: /yyyy/yyyy-mm-dd/. My code files and plot image files were already named fairly well. yyyy-mm-dd.R was the format for the code files, and yyyy-mm-dd_plot_title.png was the format for the plot image files. This seems to line up well enough with Nicola’s standard, so I’ll leave them as is."
