    "text": "A blog?\nI’ve decided to start a blog. I’m not particularly great at writing nor am I keen on making my writing public for the World to see. So what am I doing here?\nWell, a blog seems like a great way for Data People to gather and share their work in a centralized place. I’m a Data Person. I don’t currently have a place to share my work but I’ve been meaning to create one for a long time. I guess I’ll go with a blog.\nI also became familiar with Quarto and Quarto blogs after virtually attending rstudio::conf(2022). Quarto seemed like an interesting tool to present personal data work and Quarto blogs seemed like a dead simple way to compile that work. Why not start a blog to get the hang of this tool?\n\n\nPlans\nFor the most part, this blog will consist of things for my own personal consumption and reference. Like I said, I’m not eager to share my work or my thoughts broadly but I’d still like to have a place where I can direct people if I need to ~ show off ~ for any reason. This will be that place.\nI plan to write about personal projects I’m working on, an analysis that I completed, maybe some thoughts and learnings from a book or a blog I’m reading, or perhaps just write for the sake of writing. A blog seems like a good place to compile these things, kind of like a journal, especially if I’ll be the primary consumer. I’d like to have this as a place where I can log things that I’m excited about.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis is my first attempt at a blog and it wasn’t overly complicated to set-up thanks to a couple of really helpful references.\nAlbert Rapp created The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog which has been a phenomenal resource for me. Perhaps the best advice in this behemoth of a blog plost is to write regularly. I’ll give it a try, Albert!\nIsabella Velásquez also walked through building a blog with Quarto in this Youtube video. Thanks for this!"

    "text": "Introduciton\nI started getting into TidyTuesday again recently. This, timed with Nicola Rennie’s post about her webR powered Shiny App, inspired me to try and build a Shiny App to display my TidyTuesday plots! And by build, I mean re-create (rip-off?) her Shiny App, but with my plots.\n\n\nTidy directory\nRight off the hop, she talks about a pretty consistent structure to her TidyTuesday repository. Looking at mine, it’s not completely disorganized but could use some tidying. I guess a TidyTuesday repository should be tidy so let’s go ahead and do that.\nFirst, a separate directory to organize each week’s TidyTuesday plots and code: /yyyy/yyyy-mm-dd/. My code files and plot image files were already named fairly well. yyyy-mm-dd.R was the format for the code files, and yyyy-mm-dd_plot_title.png was the format for the plot image files. This seems to line up well enough with Nicola’s standard, so I’ll leave them as is.\nShe also leverages the READMEs she has for each Tidy Tuesday to extract information about the plot title for that specific week. There are occasions where I save multiple plots for a single Tidy Tuesday so I might have to approach this a bit differently. For now, I’ll copy this approach as my initial idea to extract the plot titles from file names seemed messy. Maybe I can just reference my favourite plot from the week. Or perhaps the READMEs can have both plots. Regardless, I’m going to add some READMEs!\n\n\nExtract directory info\nNext up - create a tibble with information on all the Tidy Tuesday files in my Tidy Tuesday repository. Feel free to check out the post that outlines the code in more detail but a couple of neat lessons that I took away from this part:\n\nlist.dirs(): a fun little function to produce a character vector with file names and directory names in a specified directory! Kind of surprised I haven’t needed anything like this in the past\ntidyr::separate_wider_delim(): a handy tool to split up a string column into multiple string columns based on a delimeter. This function is handy because it handles when there are too few or too many splits. In this case, if there are too many cases, we just drop the remainder.\ntidyr::separate_longer_delim():\nmutate(new_col = NA_character_): instead of blindly assigning NA values to a new column, this ensures it is a character column! Looks like you can do this with integers and real numbers as well. I’m sure there are others but a quick google search didn’t bring up a full list.\nstop(): this wasn’t referenced in the blog post but I wasn’t sure how to handle errors in R. I think this seems to be a suitable replacement for the try/except statements that I’m used to in python\nattachment: this library was leveraged to find the packages used for each Tidy Tuesday script. Had not seen this before. Pretty cool.\ntidyr::complete():"

    "text": "To be honest, I didn’t think I’d get to day 2. This is a pretty big accomplishment. I can now draw a trend line. Two days in a row, baby!\nToday I completed the tedious task of creating READMEs for each of my contributions to Tidy Tuesday. This was a good exercise in making my weekly submissions more visible, as well as setting my repository up for extracting plot titles for the webR app I’m working on. It also helped me realize that I have quite a few unfinished Tidy Tuesday plots.\nThis reminds me that I should probably brainstorm some things I may want to accomplish over these 5 weeks. Considering I made it to day 2 (hell yeah!), there is a much more likely chance that I may actually accomplish a few things here. Here’s what I have so far:\n\nClean up and finish half baked Tidy Tuesday submissions\n\nSome you’ve barely started to code, some you’ve got a pretty garbage looking plot. Clean these bad boys up, Mike!\nWhile I’m here, might as well keep up the weekly habit of contributing to Tidy Tuesday! Flex those ggplot muscles, brother!\nMore Tidy Tuesday thoughts… What am I learning about each week? Maybe write more about that.\n\nCreate a shareable webR app to display Tidy Tuesday submissions\n\nI’m hoping this webR app doesn’t dominate this “blog” over the next 5 weeks but it’s been a slow go so far. But for a good reason. It’s been a great learning exercise. Why rush through it?\n\nDevelop a Shiny application for viewing basic Ultimate statistics\n\nThis will be a relatively easy exercise (famous last words you doof!) but it’s been a while since I’ve created anything in Shiny. Time to get on this band wagon again.\n\nFigure out how I can intersect my interest in data and my interest in radio/music\n\nI host a weekly radio program where I select records for 90 minutes. I have over 4,000 songs that I’ve played over the last 4 years. Why not tell some sort of data story here?\n\nExplore Survival Analysis in Tidy Models\n\nI’ve been thinking about a lot of different work related use cases for Survival Analysis recently. Why not check out how it’s done in Tidy Models? I’m sure they make it fairly straight forward to do!\n\nPlot GitHub contributions at the end of the 5 weeks\n\nThere was a ggplot version of this plot that I came across. Try and re-create this.\n\n\nPerhaps I can do some more brainstorming later but I think that’s a good start. Lots to think about over the next 5 weeks!"

    "text": "The biggest question I had for myself when starting this 5 week challenge was whether I would continue to bother with this after a day or two. The other was would I be able to find the time. There is plenty of time on the weekend to chip away at this portfolio, but what about weekdays?\nWell, here I am on a Monday (sunglasses emoji and/or looking smug emoji). I’ve managed to find a bit of time. This might not happen every weekday but I think I can set-up a routine to at least make small progress on weekdays.\nToday (Monday), I set my alarm a bit earlier than normal so that I could spend a bit of time on something prior to work. This should work on most weekdays but I might have to find a different strategy for Tuesdays. I moonlight as a radio DJ from 5:30 to 7:00 AM on Tuesday mornings and there ain’t no way I’m waking up any earlier than I normally do. I also play a little friz on Tuesday evenings so it might be tight! That’s a problem for tomorrow…\nA couple of things accomplished today:\n\nCombined two plots into one for one of my Tidy Tuesday submissions. To showcase Tidy Tuesday plots on a webR app, it seems easier to have one plot per week. I should be good on this front now.\nTested nested lists and nested vectors in R for storing a package list for each Tidy Tuesday script. Developing primarily in python over the last few years has made this process a bit foreign to me in R. I would have used a dictionary but R does not have a built-in dictionary data structure.\nCreated a bunch of awful for loops to create logical columns to indicate whether a Tidy Tuesday week uses a specific package. Turns out there were a few tidyr and dplyr functions that thankfully replaced this whole awful mess.\n\nDecent progress. One thing I’ve learned now that I’m 3 days into this is that progress will be fairly incremental. Spending 1-2 hours a day on this portfolio won’t be enough to create something extraordinary each day. It will be small lessons, minor improvements, and hopefully over time, something worth showing off."

The plot ideas aren’t coming to me quickly here but I did manage to uncover some interesting tidbits about my timezone (Canada/Mountain).\n\nThe official record of the Canada/Mountain timezone began in 1906-09-01\nInitially, the timezone did not include daylight savings time until 1918\nDST was then abandoned between 1923 and 1942 before changing to permanent DST between 1942 and 1945\nAfter some brief back and forth between DST and standard time, permanent standard time lasted from 1947 to 1972.

    "text": "I came across this blog post yesterday while scrolling through #rstats Mastodon and it inspired me to give chattr a try in RStudio. Based on the post, it looks like chattr simply allows for interaction with LLMs via a Shiny app in RStudio (or outside RStudio in a terminal).\nHere is the install script:\n\n# Install from GitHub\nlibrary(remotes)\nremotes::install_github(\"mlverse/chattr\")\n\nDownloading GitHub repo mlverse/chattr@HEAD\n\n\nfs (1.6.3 -&gt; 1.6.4) [CRAN]\n\n\nInstalling 1 packages: fs\n\n\npackage 'fs' successfully unpacked and MD5 sums checked\n\n\nWarning: cannot remove prior installation of package 'fs'\n\n\nWarning in file.copy(savedcopy, lib, recursive = TRUE): problem copying\nC:\\Users\\miellsworth\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\R\\R-4.3.3\\library\\00LOCK\\fs\\libs\\x64\\fs.dll\nto\nC:\\Users\\miellsworth\\AppData\\Local\\Programs\\R\\R-4.3.3\\library\\fs\\libs\\x64\\fs.dll:\nPermission denied\n\n\nWarning: restored 'fs'\n\n\n\nThe downloaded binary packages are in\n    C:\\Users\\miellsworth\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpigYlbx\\downloaded_packages\n\n\nRunning `R CMD build`...\n\n\n* checking for file 'C:\\Users\\miellsworth\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\RtmpigYlbx\\remotes151c14614eb6\\mlverse-chattr-4e4d170/DESCRIPTION' ...

OK\n* checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts\n* checking for empty or unneeded directories\nOmitted 'LazyData' from DESCRIPTION\n* building 'chattr_0.1.0.tar.gz'\n\n\nIn the “Getting started” section of the post, running the app is done via the chattr_app() function but I’m getting a “No model setup found” error. Running ?chattr_use in the R Console pulls up some details to resolve this error. Looks like the easiest way to setup a model is to grab an OpenAI Personal Access Token (PAT). My preference would be to run a local LLM but maybe I can look into setting that up later.\nAfter creating a PAT on the OpenAI website, I created an .Renviron file in my project directory and saved the token there under OPENAI_API_KEY. It looks like that’s all it took to set-up the model. I can now run chattr_app().\n\nlibrary(chattr)\nchattr::chattr_app()\n\n• Provider:\n\n\n• Path/URL:\n\n\n• Model:\n\n\n• Label:\n\n\nShiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents\n\n\nThis seems to open the Shiny App but sending a prompt to OpenAI doesn’t return any response. After an unfortunate amount of time looking through Google, running chattr::chattr(\"hello\") gives me an error message that might be a clue to resolving my problem:\n{error}Type:insufficient_quota\nMessage: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.\nBased on my usage details on the OpenAI website, I should have plenty of quota to work with. Other folks online have reported a similar issue and have noted that it goes away after a few days. Perhaps I’ll check back on this later.\nThis unsuccessful AI exercise reminds me that I need to read Molly White’s article AI isn’t useless. But is it worth it?. Unfortunately, I’m not sure this foray into chattr was worth much today!"

I haven’t really rendered this thing since I’ve started and I’m not sure what the navigation looks like. Let’s spend today doing that.\nJUST KIDDING. I spent the whole day playing around with my plot for Tidy Tuesday week 2023-03-28, the timezone transitions week. In addition to struggling to figure out what to plot with this data, I spent probably an hour trying to figure out how to include a hyperlink in a ggplot2 image. A lot more difficult than I expected! I never did find a simple enough solution for my liking so I have now moved on. This stack overflow post appeared to have the most promise but the juice just wasn’t worth the squeeze for my use case. I feel like coming back to this issue but perhaps at a later date. And perhaps next Sunday I’ll get around to cleaning this blog."
