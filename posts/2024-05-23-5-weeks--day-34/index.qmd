Today's post explores an R package `marquee`, developed to parse markdown for R graphics. My first crack at the demo in the [following blog post](marquee 0.1.0 (tidyverse.org) was futile due to the inherent limitations in the default graphics device in Windows (explained in the post under the [limitations section](marquee 0.1.0 (tidyverse.org)), so I turned to my MacBook to run through a few of the examples provided.

```{r}
library(marquee)
library(ggplot2)
md_text <- "# Intro"

ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) + 
  ggtitle(md_text) + 
  theme(plot.title = element_marquee(size = 8, width = unit(16, "cm")))
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Add styling around the first word
red_bold_names <- sub("(\\w+)", "{.red **\\1**}", rownames(mtcars))

ggplot(mtcars) + 
  geom_marquee(aes(x = mpg, y = disp, label = red_bold_names))
```
