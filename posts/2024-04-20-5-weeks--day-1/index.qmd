This is a diary entry of sorts. Day 1 of spending the next 5 weeks building a data related portfolio. Something I've been meaning to do for a while now.

This is a personal challenge. Can I commit 5 weeks to building something? What can I create in that time period? Will it be any good? Let's see.

Day 1 - continued progress on a webR app to display Tidy Tuesday plots. Based on how much I'm learning from this exercise, this whole 5 week challenge could potentially be about only this.
