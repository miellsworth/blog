Sundays are for cleaning the house. I don't make the rules, that's just what Sundays are for. In keeping with this spirit, I'm going to do a little spring cleaning here at *the blog*.

Outside of the four weeks of Tidy Tuesday submissions I need to finish, I want to spend today making sure this blog looks clean. I haven't really rendered this thing since I've started and I'm not sure what the navigation looks like. Let's spend today doing that.
