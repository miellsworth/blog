At the onset of this 5 week challenge, I had an inkling that a two day out of town ultimate tourney might throw a wrench into my plans. Would I be able to complete my daily contribution while grinding it out on the ulti field? The answer is no. Hence why day 15 and 16 are contributionless. However, I'm plowing ahead!

Day 17 of this 5 week challenge.
