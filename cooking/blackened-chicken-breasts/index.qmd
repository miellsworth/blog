# Ingredients
- 1 tbsp kosher salt
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika
- 0.5 tbsp dried thyme
- 0.5 tbsp dried oregano
- 0.5 tbsp garlic powder
- 0.5 tbsp onion powder
- 1 teaspoon mustard powder
- 1 teaspoon ground cayenne
- 2 chicken breasts, 1.5 to 2 pounds, room temp
- 2 tbsp vegetable oil

# Instructions
## 1
- Make the blackening seasoning: In a small bowl, combine the salt, smoked paprika, thyme, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard powder and cayenne

## 2
- Carefully slice the chicken breasts horizontally in half, then pat dry with a paper towel
- Thoroughly coat all sides with the blackening seasoning and set aside

## 3
- Drizzle oil into a large skillet or cast iron pan over medium-high
- When the oil begins to shimmer, carefully place the chicken in the pan and cook undisturbed for 5 minutes
- Watch out for any oil splattering and popping out of the pan
- Cook until the seasoning literally darkens
- After 5 minutes, flip the chicken and cook for another 3 minutes

## 4
- Turn off the heat and leave the pan tented with aluminum foil for 5 minutes (this will help the chicken continue cooking from the residual heat without drying out)
- Remove the foil, then let the chicken rest for at least 2 minutes

## 5
- When ready to serve, slice the chicken into 0.5-inch pieces. Serve immediately
