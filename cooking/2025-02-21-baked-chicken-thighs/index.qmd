# Ingredients
⅓cup olive oil
1tablespoon minced garlic (about 2 large cloves)
1tablespoon Dijon mustard
2teaspoons dried thyme, rosemary or oregano (or 1 tablespoon fresh), or 2 teaspoons Italian seasoning
1½teaspoons kosher salt (such as Diamond Crystal), plus more for serving
1teaspoon black pepper
1lemon
6 to 8skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs (about 3 pounds), patted dry
Chopped fresh parsley, for serving (optional)

# Instructions
## 1
In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, mustard, thyme, salt and pepper. Zest the lemon over the bowl, reserving the rest of the lemon for serving, and whisk until combined.

## 2
Add the chicken thighs to the bowl, tossing until fully coated in the marinade. Cover and let marinate for 30 minutes at room temperature, or up to 12 hours in the refrigerator.

## 3
Heat the oven to 425 degrees and lift the chicken thighs from the marinade, letting any excess drip into the bowl. Place the thighs on a sheet pan and let them sit at room temperature while the oven heats. Bake until fully cooked and lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. An internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat should read 165 to 175 degrees.

## 4
Cut the lemon in half and squeeze over the chicken. Sprinkle with salt and serve.
