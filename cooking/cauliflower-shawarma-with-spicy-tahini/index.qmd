- 1 fat garlic clove, minced
- 0.25 tsp fine sea or table salt

- 1/3 cup ice water, plus more as needed

# Instructions
## 1
- Arrange racks in the upper and lower thirds of your oven
- Heat oven to 425 degrees

## 2 Prepare the cauliflower
- In a large bowl, whisk together:
  - olive oil
  - cumin
  - paprika
  - salt
  - coriander
  - turmeric
  - black pepper
  - cayenne
- Add cauliflower and onion, and toss until well coated
- Spread mixture in a single layer on a rimmed baking sheet

## 3
- Roast vegetables on the top oven rack until they are golden brown, slightly crisp and tender, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring once or twice
- If the vegetables look dry as they roast, drizzle with a little more olive oil

## 4 Prepare the tahini sauce
- Whisk together in a small bowl and let sit for a minute or two to mellow the garlic:
  - lemon juice
  - 1 tsp harissa
  - garlic
  - salt
- Whisk in tahini
- Whisk in ice water, 1 tbsp at a time, until the sauce is smooth and thin enough to drizzle
- You may not need all of the water or you may need to add a little more: Tahini brands vary a lot
- Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more harissa, lemon juice and salt if you like
- The sauce should taste zippy and creamy.

## 5
- Warm the pitas or flatbread by placing them directly on the bottom oven rack during the last 5 minutes as the vegetables roast
- Or you can warm the bread on another baking pan if that’s easier for you

## 6
- Scatter parsley on top of the roasted vegetables and serve with warm pitas, tahini sauce, chopped tomato, cucumber and olives
