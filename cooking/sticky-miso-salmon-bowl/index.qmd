# Ingredients
- 2 cups sushi rice
- 3 tbsp white miso
- 2 tbsp honey
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tbsp freshly grated ginger
- 2 teaspoons fresh grapefruit zest plus 1 tbsp juice
- 4 x 6-8oz skinless salmon fillets, patted dry
- Salt and pepper
- 4 green onions, thinly sliced
- 1 tbsp unsalted butter, cubed
- Any combination of kimchi, chile crisp, toasted nori sheets, and sliced cucumber, avocado or radish, for serving

# Instructions
## 1
- Put the rice in a medium bowl and fill with cool tap water
- Run your fingers through the rice, gently swooshing the grains around to loosen the starch
- Dump out as much water as you can and repeat until the water runs slightly more clear, another two to three rinses

## 2
- Drain the rice and transfer to a small or medium saucepan that has a tight-fitting lid
- Pour in 2.25 cups cool water and bring to a boil over medium-high
- Give the rice a stir to help keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot, then cover and decrease heat to low
- Cook without lifting the lid for 18 minutes
- Set your timer!

## 3
- While the rice is cooking, place a rack about 5 inches from the broiler heat source and set the broiler to high
- Whisk the miso, honey, oil, ginger and grapefruit zest and juice in a large bowl
- Season the salmon lightly with salt and add to the bowl
- Gently toss to coat
- Marinate at room temperature until the timer for the rice goes off

## 4
- Remove the pot of rice from the heat and let steam, covered, for 10 minutes, while you cook the salmon

## 5
- Using tongs, arrange the salmon on a foil-lined rimmed sheet tray
- Make sure to leave the marinade on and spread any excess on top of the fillets. (This step will make for better browning
- Broil the salmon until glossy and charred in most spots, about 5 minutes for medium-rare or 7 minutes for medium
- Your timing will also depend on whether or not you'd like a little char on top

## 6
- Uncover the rice and add the scallions and butter
- Season with salt and several grinds of pepper
- Fluff the rice with a rubber spatula until each grain is coated
- Serve the salmon over the rice and add any of the toppings you desire
