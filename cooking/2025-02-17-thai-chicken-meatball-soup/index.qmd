# Ingredients

-   4" piece ginger
-   6 garlic cloves
-   1 jalapeño
-   1kg ground chicken
-   1 large bunch cilantro, leaves and stems finely chopped, a few whole leaves reserved for serving
-   3 tbsp fish sauce
-   2 tbsp vegetable oil
-   500ml chicken broth
-   14oz can full-fat coconut milk
-   1/2 tsp granulated sugar
-   140g baby spinach
-   1 tbsp lime juice, plus wedges for serving
-   Rice, for serving

# Instructions

## 1

-   Cook rice
-   Finely chop leaves and steams of cilantro, leaving a few leaves for serving
-   Microplane ginger, garlic and jalapeño (or finely chop them by hand)
-   Transfer half to a large bowl and set the rest aside
-   To the large bowl, add the chicken, finely chopped cilantro, 2 tbsp fish sauce and 1 tsp salt
-   Use your hands to fully combine but do not overmix

## 2

-   Use your hands or spoon to form 2-inch meatballs (2oz)
-   In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat the oil over medium heat
-   Working in batches, add the meatballs in a single layer and cook, flipping halfway through, until golden brown on two sides, 5-8 minutes
-   Transfer to a plate and repeat, adding oil as needed

## 3

-   Once meatballs are browned and out of the pot, if the oil is burned, wipe it out and add a bit more to the pot
-   Reduce the heat a bit, add the reserved ginger mixture and sauté until fragrant, about 1 minute
-   Add the chicken broth, coconut milk, sugar and the remaining 1 tablespoon fish sauce, and bring to a simmer
-   Add the meatballs and any juices from the plate, and simmer until the flavors come together and the meatballs are cooked through, 5-8 minutes

## 4

-   Remove from heat, and stir in the spinach and lime juice
-   Divide rice among bowls, then top with meatballs, broth and cilantro
-   Serve with lime wedges
