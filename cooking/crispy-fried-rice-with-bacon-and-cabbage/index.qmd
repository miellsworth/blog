# Instructions
## 1
- In a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium-high, heat 2 tbsp oil until almost smoking

- Transfer to a heatproof bowl, leaving as much oil in the skillet as you can

## 2

- Cook until soft, stirring frequently, 1 to 2 minutes
- If the pan looks dry, drizzle in a little more oil, then stir in cabbage and a pinch of salt

- Stir in garlic, and cook until fragrant, another 1 to 2 minutes
- Transfer to the bowl with the bacon

## 3
- Add remaining 3 tbsps oil to skillet and raise heat to high
- Add rice, and a large pinch of salt, then toss thoroughly to coat with oil
- Spread out rice in an even layer along the bottom (and sides if in a wok), and drizzle fish sauce and soy sauce over
- Let rice sit until sizzling stops and it starts to crackle and crisp, 1 to 4 minutes
- Toss, taste, and add more fish sauce or soy sauce if necessary

## 4
