## 2
- Carefully drain the liquid from the package of tofu, and gently tip the block onto a kitchen towel
- Try to keep the block in one piece, if possible, but don’t worry if it falls apart; it will still taste great
- Pat with another clean kitchen towel, removing as much liquid as possible
- Transfer the blocks to one large plate or two smaller plates — leave whole or cut into 1-inch blocks — and spoon the soy dressing over the top until the tofu is completely covered
- Top with scallions and cilantro leaves, and eat on its own or with rice or noodles on the side
