# Ingredients
- 0.5 cup mayonnaise
- 0.5 cup Dijon mustard
- 2 garlic cloves, finely grated
- Salt and black pepper
- 1 tsp thyme leaves or dried thyme
- 1.5 to 2 lb chicken breasts or thighs, patted dry

# Instructions
## 1
- Heat a grill to medium-high
- (You can also cook the chicken on the stovetop over medium-high heat, following the same timing.)
- Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir together the mayonnaise, mustard and garlic, and season to taste with salt and pepper
- Transfer half to a small bowl and refrigerate until serving.

## 2
- To the medium bowl with the reserved Dijonnaise, stir in the thyme leaves
- Season the chicken all over with salt and pepper, then transfer to the medium bowl and toss to coat
- Let sit at least 15 minutes, or refrigerate up to overnight
- (Let it come to room temperature before cooking.)

## 3
- Clean the grill grates
- No need to grease; the mayonnaise keeps the chicken from sticking
- Scrape excess marinade off the chicken, then grill over direct heat until the chicken unsticks from the grates and is deep golden and cooked through, 4 to 6 minutes per side
- If using a gas grill, cover grill between flips
- Discard the chicken marinade
- Serve with the small bowl of reserved Dijonnaise alongside
