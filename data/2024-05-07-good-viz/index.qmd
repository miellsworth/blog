I came across a [really well done Tidy Tuesday submission](https://github.com/poncest/tidytuesday/tree/main/2024/Week_19) yesterday courtesy of Steven Ponce. One thing I love to do when I come across great viz is dive into the source code and check out all the clever ways they managed to make it happen. This example is no different.

For today's submission, I'm going to create my own Tidy Tuesday submission while incorporating a couple of learnings from Steven's submission.
