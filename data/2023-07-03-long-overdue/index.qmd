# A blog?

I've decided to start a blog. I'm not particularly great at writing nor am I keen on making my writing public for the World to see. So what am I doing here?

Well, a blog seems like a great way for Data People to gather and share their work in a centralized place. I'm a Data Person. I don't currently have a place to share my work but I've been meaning to create one for a *long* time. I guess I'll go with a blog.

I also became familiar with Quarto and Quarto blogs after virtually attending rstudio::conf(2022). Quarto seemed like an interesting tool to present personal data work and Quarto blogs seemed like a dead simple way to compile that work. Why not start a blog to get the hang of this tool?

# Plans

For the most part, this blog will consist of things for my own personal consumption and reference. Like I said, I'm not eager to share my work or my thoughts broadly but I'd still like to have a place where I can direct people if I need to \~ *show off \~* for any reason. This will be that place.

I plan to write about personal projects I'm working on, an analysis that I completed, maybe some thoughts and learnings from a book or a blog I'm reading, or perhaps just write for the sake of writing. A blog seems like a good place to compile these things, kind of like a journal, especially if I'll be the primary consumer. I'd like to have this as a place where I can log things that I'm excited about.

# Acknowledgments

This is my first attempt at a blog and it wasn't overly complicated to set-up thanks to a couple of really helpful references.

Albert Rapp created [The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html) which has been a phenomenal resource for me. Perhaps the best advice in this behemoth of a blog plost is to *write regularly*. I'll give it a try, Albert!

Isabella Vel√°squez also walked through [building a blog with Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVcvXfRyfE0) in this Youtube video. Thanks for this!
