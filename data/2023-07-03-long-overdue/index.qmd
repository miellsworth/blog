# A data blog?

I think that is what this will be. A blog seems like a great way for Data People to compile their work in a centralized place. I'm a Data Person. I don't currently have a place to store my work. I guess I'll go with a blog.

I also became familiar with Quarto after virtually attending rstudio::conf(2022). Quarto seemed like an interesting tool to present personal data work. Why not start a blog to get the hang of this tool?

# Plans

For the most part, this will consist of things for my own personal consumption and reference. Perhaps more of a notepad than a blog. I'm not keen to broadly share my work or my thoughts but I'd like to have a personal reference for things I do related to data.

I plan to share details on personal projects, some random data viz, and/or perhaps some thoughts from something I'm reading. A blog seems like a good place to compile these things, kind of like a journal, especially if I'll be the primary consumer. I'd like to have this as a place where I can log things that I'm excited about.

# Acknowledgments

This is my first attempt at a blog and it wasn't overly complicated to set-up thanks to a couple of really helpful references.

Albert Rapp created [The ultimate guide to starting a Quarto blog](https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html) which has been a phenomenal resource for me.

Isabella Velásquez also walked through [building a blog with Quarto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVcvXfRyfE0) in this Youtube video. Really good stuff.
