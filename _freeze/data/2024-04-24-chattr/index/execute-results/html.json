Based on the post, it looks like `chattr` simply allows for interaction with LLMs via a Shiny app in RStudio (or outside RStudio in a terminal).\n\nHere is the install script:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install from GitHub\nlibrary(remotes)\nremotes::install_github(\"mlverse/chattr\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nIn the \"Getting started\" section of the post, running the app is done via the `chattr_app()` function but I'm getting a \"No model setup found\" error. Running `?chattr_use` in the R Console pulls up some details to resolve this error. Looks like the easiest way to setup a model is to grab an OpenAI Personal Access Token (PAT). My preference would be to run a local LLM but maybe I can look into setting that up later.\n\nAfter creating a PAT on the OpenAI website, I created an .Renviron file in my project directory and saved the token there under `OPENAI_API_KEY`. It looks like that's all it took to set-up the model. I can now run `chattr_app()`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(chattr)\nchattr::chattr_app()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n• Provider:\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n• Path/URL:\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n• Model:\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n• Label:\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`<div style=\"width: 100% ; height: 400px ; text-align: center; box-sizing: border-box; -moz-box-sizing: border-box; -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;\" class=\"muted well\">Shiny applications not supported in static R Markdown documents</div>`{=html}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis seems to open the Shiny App but sending a prompt to OpenAI doesn't return any response. After an unfortunate amount of time looking through Google, running `chattr::chattr(\"hello\")` gives me an error message that might be a clue to resolving my problem:\n\n```         \n{error}Type:insufficient_quota\nMessage: You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.\n```\n\nBased on my usage details on the OpenAI website, I should have plenty of quota to work with. Other folks online have reported a similar issue and have noted that it goes away after a few days. Perhaps I'll check back on this later.\n\nThis unsuccessful AI exercise reminds me that I need to read Molly White's article [AI isn't useless. But is it worth it?](https://www.citationneeded.news/ai-isnt-useless/). Unfortunately, I'm not sure this foray into `chattr` was worth much today!\n",
